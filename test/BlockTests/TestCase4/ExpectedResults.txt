[Keep]In computing, the utility diff is a data comparison tool that computes  and  displays
[Keep]the differences between the contents of files. Unlike edit distance notions used  for
[Keep]other purposes, diff is line-oriented rather than character-oriented, but it  is like
[Keep]Levenshtein distance in that it tries to determine the smallest set of  deletions and
[Keep]insertions to create one file from the other. The utility displays the changes in one
[Keep]of several standard formats, such that both humans or computers can parse the changes
[Keep]and use them for patching. Typically, diff is used to  show the  changes  between two
[Keep]versions of the same file. Modern implementations support binary files to. The output
[Keep]is called a "diff", or a patch, since the output can be applied with the Unix program
[Keep]patch. The output of similar file comparison utilities are also called a "diff"; like
[Keep]the use of the word "grep" for describing the act of searching, the word diff  became
[Keep]a generic term for calculating data difference and the results  thereof. The POSIX bn
[Keep]standard specifies the  behavior of the  "diff" and  "patch" utilities and their file
[Delete]formats. Diff was developed in the early 1970s on the Unix operating system which was

[Keep]initial prototype of diff. The algorithm this paper described  became  known as  Hunt
[Keep]Szymanski algorithm. McIlroy's work  was preceded and  influenced by  Steve Johnson's
[Keep]comparison program on GECOS and Mike Lesk's  proof program. Proof also  originated on
[Keep]Unix and, like diff, produced line-by-line changes and even used  angle-brackets (">"
[Keep]and "<") for  presenting line  insertions and  deletions in the program's output. The
[Keep]heuristics used in  these early  applications were,  however,  deemed unreliable. The
[Keep]potential usefulness of a diff tool provoked McIlroy into researching and designing a
[Keep]more robust tool that could be used in a variety of tasks but perform well in the pro
[Keep]cessing and size limitations of the PDP-11's hardware. His approach to the problem re
[Keep]sulted from collaboration also with individuals at Bell Labs including Alfred Aho, El
[Keep]liot Pinson, Jeffrey Ullman, and Harold S. Stone. In the context of Unix, the use  of
[Keep]the ed line editor provided diff with the  natural ability  to create  machine-usable
[Keep]"edit scripts". These edit scripts, when saved to a file, can, along with the  origin
[Keep]file, be reconstituted by ed into the modified file in its entirety. This greatly red
[Keep]uced the secondary storage necessary to maintain multiple versions of a file. McIlroy
[Keep]considered writing a post-processor for diff where a variety of output formats  could
[Keep]be designed and implemented, but he found it more frugal and simpler to have diff  be

[Keep]and. Late in 1984 Larry Wall created a separate utility, patch, releasing  its source
[Keep]code on the mod.sources and net.sources newsgroups. This program generalized and exte
[Keep]nded the ability to modify files with output from diff. Modes in Emacs also allow for
[Keep]converting the format of patches and even editing patches interactively. In diff's ea
[Keep]rly years, common uses included comparing changes in the source of software  code and
[Keep]markup for technical documents, verifying program debugging output, comparing filesys
[Keep]tem listings and analyzing computer assembly code. The output targeted for ed was mot
[Keep]ivated to provide compression for a sequence of modifications made to a file. The Sou
[Keep]rce Code Control System (SCCS) and its ability to archive revisions emerged in the la
[Keep]te 1970s as a consequence of storing edit scripts from diff. The diff command is invo
[Keep]ked from the command line, passing it the names of two files: diff original  new. The
[Keep]output of the command represents the changes required to transform  the original file
[Keep]into the new file. If original and new are directories, then diff will be run on each
[Keep]file that exists in both directories. An option, -r, will recursively descend any mat
[Keep]ching subdirectories to compare files between directories. Any of the examples in the
[Keep]article use the following two files, original and new:
