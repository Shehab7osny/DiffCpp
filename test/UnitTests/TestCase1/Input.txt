In computing, the utility diff is a data comparison tool that computes  and  displays
the differences between the contents of files. Unlike edit distance notions used  for
other purposes, diff is line-oriented rather than character-oriented, but it  is like
Levenshtein distance in that it tries to determine the smallest set of  deletions and
insertions to create one file from the other. The utility displays the changes in one
of several standard formats, such that both humans or computers can parse the changes
and use them for patching. Typically, diff is used to  show the  changes  between two
versions of the same file. Modern implementations support binary files to. The output
is called a "diff", or a patch, since the output can be applied with the Unix program
patch. The output of similar file comparison utilities are also called a "diff"; like
the use of the word "grep" for describing the act of searching, the word diff  became
a generic term for calculating data difference and the results  thereof. The POSIX bn
standard specifies the  behavior of the  "diff" and  "patch" utilities and their file
formats. Diff was developed in the early 1970s on the Unix operating system which was
emerging from Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. The final version, first  shipped
with the 5th Edition of Unix in 1974,  was entirely  written by Douglas McIlroy. This
research was published in a 1976 paper co-written with James W. Hunt who developed an
initial prototype of diff. The algorithm this paper described  became  known as  Hunt
Szymanski algorithm. McIlroy's work  was preceded and  influenced by  Steve Johnson's
